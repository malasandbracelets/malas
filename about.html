            <p> In my teachings stories are medicine, and these stories help to lead people inward. For anyone who has read a collection of tales like, “Women Who Run with the Wolves,” (and if you haven't you should) you may have noticed a few things. It is hard to read that book, those stories, without at some point slowing down. Some part of you reaches out and tries to make sense of feelings and thoughts rising to a surface you did not know that you had. There are many interpretations of stories and many ways to engage with them. I humbly offer up some of my teachings in the hope that they will fit for you. </p>
            <p>There are certain stories that wake us up; a part of us is recognized in a piece of story. Story can be described as a storehouse- the collective wisdom of a people preserved like DNA in an oral tradition to be passed on and maintained. These storehouses open and play out on an inner landscape, each piece and part of story a part of ourselves. The literal roles of characters can be dropped and replaced with characteristics of the self. The predatory male reflects a destructive force within ourselves that destroys intuition. Senseless deaths become necessary in the shedding of the old. Rights of passage and healing play out across the psyche, ingested through sound. Emotions and states can be evoked and those stories work until they become a part of you. I was taught, ‘pay attention to where you come into a story, that story holds something for you’. These stories, they lead you in. 

</p>
<p>In some traditions, this process of going in and learning to listen for yourself, to journey through your landscape, is akin to shamanistic work. Mostly intuitive, it requires a new kind of hearing that stems from within; empower is the process of power coming from within. This journey is not one you can be told how to do, it requires instead a facilitator. Facilitators appear as space and tools for exploration. Stories must be honoured, grappled with, lived- wisdom is not given it is experienced. 
</p> 
<p>It is my hope to share some of what stories and storytelling have done for me, so that they may be of meaning or use to you on your journey. It is said when two parties come together and connect, both are changed from that simple connection. When a story speaks to you, settle down and let it lead you into that in. You will be transformed from the meeting. 
I share the oral tradition because it is how these stories were shared to me. None of them are my own, and many show up across cultures thematically. It is important to honour the legacy of storytelling, because these stories and the people who spoke them survived a long time, to pass on important meaning and guiding values. 

Maybe these stories will speak to you, and maybe they will only provide humour and laughter. Either way, may they bring you some good in this life.

        <p>Stories and malas lead a person inward. It has been important to me for a long time, this process of turning in. Intuitively, I knew what would become hard to explain only in words; to know oneself, love oneself, and at once stand a chance to love another, one had to first go in. I offer up these stories, my teachings, so that they may inspire you to go in. The greatest stories are taking place across your inner landscape and my hope is, to encourage you to look inward to your own wisdom and hear the parts that may have become silenced, again. That this process may honour all of your voices, and empower you in creating a life that inspires you. 
</p>
<p>Someone once told me - Look within, you are the world.
Change starts at home, it starts with you. By design, when you change, the world around you must change or dissolve, end. The way you have been living must not work, enough, to want a change. Do not bang on the doors of other people and demand they change - change. Meet them with a changed heart, a changed boundary, a changed response. Walk through the world in a strong way, not taking at that of others and not forgetting yourself. Balance is a moment, not a state. And life does not get easier, you simply become stronger.
Look within - you are the world.’
</p>
<p>May these malas and these stories, both blessings to me, bring you comfort, courage and laughter. For what is comfort than coming home to oneself; courage but persisting action through fear; and laughter but the glue in an astonishing world. All my relations, now that is yours to share.
